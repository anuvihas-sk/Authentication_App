Introduction
This app provides basic authentication features, allowing users to:

Register an account using their email and password.
Log in with their credentials.
Log out from the app.
This app is built using React Native with Expo for fast development and testing. Firebase Authentication is used to handle user authentication on the backend.

Technologies Used
React Native: Framework for building native apps using React.
Expo: Toolchain to quickly develop and deploy React Native apps.
Firebase: Backend service for handling authentication and user management.
React Navigation: Library for navigating between different screens in the app.
Expo Managed Workflow: Expo's managed environment for rapid app development.
Setup and Installation
To run this app locally, follow these steps:

Prerequisites
Node.js (version 14 or higher)
Expo CLI (install via npm install -g expo-cli)
A Firebase project (for authentication)
Steps
Clone this repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/your-username/authentication-app.git
cd authentication-app
Install dependencies:

Install the required dependencies using npm or yarn:

bash
Copy code
npm install
or

bash
Copy code
yarn install
Set up Firebase:

Go to Firebase Console and create a new Firebase project.
Enable Email/Password Authentication in the Firebase Authentication settings.
Copy the Firebase configuration object from your Firebase project and add it to the app.
Example Firebase configuration:

javascript
Copy code
const firebaseConfig = {
  apiKey: "YOUR_API_KEY",
  authDomain: "YOUR_PROJECT_ID.firebaseapp.com",
  projectId: "YOUR_PROJECT_ID",
  storageBucket: "YOUR_PROJECT_ID.appspot.com",
  messagingSenderId: "YOUR_SENDER_ID",
  appId: "YOUR_APP_ID",
};
Add Firebase configuration to your app:

Create a file called firebaseConfig.js in the root of the project and paste your Firebase config into it.

javascript
Copy code
import firebase from "firebase/app";
import "firebase/auth";

const firebaseConfig = {
  apiKey: "YOUR_API_KEY",
  authDomain: "YOUR_PROJECT_ID.firebaseapp.com",
  projectId: "YOUR_PROJECT_ID",
  storageBucket: "YOUR_PROJECT_ID.appspot.com",
  messagingSenderId: "YOUR_SENDER_ID",
  appId: "YOUR_APP_ID",
};

// Initialize Firebase
if (!firebase.apps.length) {
  firebase.initializeApp(firebaseConfig);
} else {
  firebase.app(); // If already initialized
}

export { firebase };
Run the app with Expo:

After setting up Firebase, you can run the app locally with:

bash
Copy code
expo start
This will start the Expo development server and open the app in your default browser. You can scan the QR code with the Expo Go app to test it on a physical device.
